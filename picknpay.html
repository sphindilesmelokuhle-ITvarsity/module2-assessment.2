        <h2>PICK N PAY</h2>
        <p>Pick n Pay is a retail business in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. We operate through multiple store formats under three brands – Pick n Pay, Boxer and TM Supermarkets – and have the largest online grocery business in Africa.</p>
        <p>Pick n Pay is an inclusive brand focused on being the retailer for all – from the most affluent in society to those who are less fortunate and for whom price is of the utmost importance. Middle-income South African consumers make up the largest portion of our customer base. Pick n Pay operates on an owned and franchise basis and provides a wide range of products and value-added services that include an online offering. Pick n Pay is focused on delivering an exceptional customer offer, including range, quality, price, availability and service. Pick n Pay has a strong growth plan that benefits from flexible formats and a leaner operating model. Pick n Pay is focused on bringing its offer to communities where we are not yet well represented, including through small convenience stores.</p>

        <p>It is free to sign up for a Pick n Pat Smart Shopper account which customers can use to earn and spend points on a variety of deals. ... Pick n Pay allows users to spend these points on any item in-store, swap them out for other partner rewards and even donate them to charity.</p>
        <p>Smart Shoppers can switch their points to cash that can be spent at Pick n Pay stores. Every 100 points gets you R1. If you spent R100 at Pick n Pay using your Smart Shopper card, you would get 50 points. These points would be worth 50c if you convert them to cash.</p>
        <p>Smart Shopper points are valid for 12 months from the time you earn them. Points that were earned more than 12 months ago and which have not been used will expire and will continue to expire on a rolling month basis.</p>
