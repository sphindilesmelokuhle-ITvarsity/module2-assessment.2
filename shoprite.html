        <h2>SHOPRITE</h2>
        <p>The Shoprite Group of Companies started from small beginnings in 1979 with the purchase of a chain of 8 Cape-based supermarkets for R1 million. ... A year later Shoprite sped up its growth by buying six food stores from Ackermans. In 1986 the Group expanded to the Free State, opening a store in Bloemfontein. Shoprite's objective is to provide all communities in Africa with food and household items in a first-world shopping environment, at the lowest prices.</p>
        <p>Shoprite has generated its success through astute management while also tapping into the growth evident in the lower to middle-income market. The group has also benefitted from the huge cost-savings it has achieved through employing a centralised distribution strategy.</p>
